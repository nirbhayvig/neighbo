**Neighbo Business Plan**

A values-based business finder

## **Executive Summary**

### **Core Thesis**

The Values-Based Restaurant Finder leverages values alignment to drive real foot traffic to businesses. Unlike platforms such as Yelp or Google Maps, it matches users’ declared values—like sustainability, inclusivity, or ownership type—to businesses that share those values. This increases the likelihood that users will choose those restaurants, turning alignment into measurable, high-intent visits. As user density grows, the platform delivers more precise matching, boosting both organic discovery and the effectiveness of paid advertising and analytics subscriptions.

### **Product**

The product is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that allows users to create free accounts, input the values that matter to them, and filter restaurants accordingly. Users can search by multiple values simultaneously, view tiered certification badges (Tier 1 self-attested, Tier 2 community-vetted, Tier 3 moderator-verified), explore listings on a map, and contribute reports.

Businesses can also claim and manage a basic listing for free. However, premium functionality is reserved for paying business customers. These premium offerings include fixed-price advertising placements (such as sponsored listings within defined geographic areas) and subscription-based analytics dashboards that provide aggregated insights into user value preferences, search frequency trends, and neighborhood-level demand density.

### **Customers**

The company has one paying customer segment: restaurants and hospitality businesses. These businesses pay either for advertising visibility or for subscription access to analytics insights, or both. Consumers do not pay for access and are not monetized directly; their aggregated, anonymized activity fuels the insights that businesses value.

### **Future**

As user density increases within a given metro area, the value of localized advertising and analytics increases proportionally. Expansion into additional cities increases inventory for fixed-price ad placements and expands the analytics dataset, strengthening recurring subscription revenue.

## **Company Description**

### **Mission**

To provide transparent, values-based discovery tools for communities while equipping local businesses with meaningful, data-driven insights about consumer values alignment.

### **Vision**

To build the leading marketplace infrastructure where consumer values and local commerce intersect transparently and measurably, enabling businesses to respond strategically to evolving community priorities.

### **Team Values**

The company prioritizes transparency, ethical data stewardship, inclusivity, accountability, and clarity in how information is presented. User trust is central, particularly in how values data is aggregated and shared. The platform is designed as a transparency engine rather than an advocacy organization.

### **Company Status**

The platform is in active development with a defined MVP and monetization framework. Launch is projected within six to nine months, beginning in the Twin Cities as a pilot market to validate engagement density and business demand.

### **Legal Structure**

Given the advertising and subscription revenue model, the company is structured as a mission-driven for-profit entity, potentially as a public benefit corporation (PBC). This allows revenue generation while formally embedding the company’s public-interest purpose.

## **Market Research**

### **Industry Classification**

The company operates at the intersection of restaurant discovery, local advertising technology, and SaaS analytics for small and mid-sized businesses. It combines elements of a consumer marketplace platform with a business intelligence provider.

### **Customer Segment Analysis**

The sole paying customer segment is restaurants and bars seeking to better understand and reach values-aligned consumers. Independent establishments and small regional groups are particularly attractive segments because they often lack sophisticated data tools yet rely heavily on local reputation and differentiation.

While users create free accounts and input their value preferences, they are not customers in the economic sense. Instead, they form the engagement base that generates anonymized behavioral insights.

### **Competitor Analysis**

Yelp and Google Maps monetize through advertising and promoted listings but do not structure analytics around explicit multi-value filters. OpenTable offers reservation-based analytics but not community value-density insights. Niche platforms such as HappyCow and EatOkra provide visibility within specific value verticals but do not offer subscription analytics dashboards based on structured behavioral filtering.

No competitor integrates user-declared values, tiered verification, fixed-price geographic advertising, and subscription analytics tied directly to value-based search behavior.

### **Company Advantages / Moat**

The primary moat is proprietary, structured behavioral data about how users filter and search by values across neighborhoods. As the dataset grows, the insights become increasingly difficult to replicate. Network effects reinforce defensibility: more users generate richer data; richer data increases subscription value; more paying businesses fund continued platform improvements.

### **Unique Value Proposition**

Businesses gain access to measurable insights about which values resonate in specific areas, how often certain filters are used, and how their listing performs relative to value trends. Rather than generic traffic metrics, the platform provides structured, value-based demand intelligence.

### **Regulatory Compliance**

All analytics are derived from aggregated and anonymized user data. No personally identifiable information is sold or exposed. Clear opt-in policies, transparent privacy disclosures, and compliance with relevant state and federal regulations govern data practices.

## **Business Model**

### **Products & Services**

The core consumer-facing platform is free for both users and businesses at the base level. Businesses can create and manage listings without charge. Revenue is generated exclusively through two paid offerings.

First, businesses may purchase fixed-price advertising placements. These may include sponsored listings within defined geographic zones or priority placement when certain value filters are selected.

Second, businesses may subscribe to an analytics dashboard. The subscription provides access to aggregated insights such as search volume by value category, geographic heat maps of value density, listing engagement metrics, and trend analysis over time.

### **Product Lifecycle**

Phase 1 focuses on launching the free consumer and business listing experience to build user density and engagement. Phase 2 introduces fixed-price advertising placements. Phase 3 launches tiered analytics subscriptions. As geographic coverage expands, the data asset grows in depth and value.

### **Pricing Model**

Advertising is sold at a fixed monthly rate based on geography or category placement. Subscription analytics are offered in tiered plans—for example, a basic tier providing search trend data, a professional tier including neighborhood heat maps and segmentation, and a higher-tier plan for multi-location operators. All consumer access remains free.

### **Unit Economics**

Infrastructure costs include hosting, mapping APIs, engineering, and moderation. Marginal cost per additional user is low. Revenue scales with the number of business advertisers and subscribers. Because subscriptions generate recurring monthly revenue, the model benefits from SaaS-style predictability once customer acquisition stabilizes.

## **Marketing & Sales**

### **Go to Market Strategy**

The initial strategy focuses on building a strong user base in the Twin Cities through community partnerships and local outreach. User density is essential because it directly increases the value of advertising placements and analytics subscriptions.

### **Customer Communication**

User-facing messaging emphasizes transparency and empowerment. Business-facing messaging emphasizes measurable demand insights, targeted visibility, and differentiation from traditional review platforms.

### **Sales Strategy**

Early business acquisition will involve direct outreach to independent restaurants, offering introductory subscription pricing or promotional advertising placements. As anonymized trend data accumulates, published insights can demonstrate platform value and support inbound sales.

### **Growth Strategy**

Growth is driven by a reinforcing cycle: increased user engagement produces richer analytics; richer analytics increase subscription value; more business customers fund further product development; improved functionality attracts additional users. Geographic expansion multiplies revenue opportunities by replicating this cycle in new markets.

## **Financial Projections**

### **Expenses & Runway**

Estimated Year 1 expenses are approximately $80,000, covering development, infrastructure, legal compliance, and marketing. The company aims to secure sufficient capital to provide at least 12 months of operational runway post-launch.

### **Revenue/Earnings**

Revenue depends entirely on business participation. A model assuming 50 advertising clients at a fixed monthly rate and 40 analytics subscribers at mid-tier pricing suggests potential annualized revenue between $75,000 and $100,000 once adoption stabilizes. Revenue scales meaningfully as business penetration increases.

### **Break Even Analysis**

Break-even is achievable once recurring subscription and advertising revenue consistently covers fixed operating costs. This may occur when approximately 60–70 businesses subscribe at mid-tier plans or through a blended mix of advertisers and subscribers generating comparable monthly recurring revenue. Because consumers are not monetized and marginal costs are low, scaling business subscriptions is the primary lever for profitability.
